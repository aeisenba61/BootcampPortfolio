select CONCAT(UPPER(first_name), ' ', UPPER(Last_name)) AS Full_Name
FROM actor
ORDER by Last_name;

-- 2a. You need to find the ID number, first name, and last name of an actor, of whom you know only the first name, "Joe." What is one query would you use to obtain this information?
select actor_id, first_name, Last_name
FROM actor
where first_name = 'Joe';

-- 2b. Find all actors whose last name contain the letters GEN:
select actor_id, first_name, Last_name
FROM actor
where last_name like '%GEN%';

select actor_id, first_name, Last_name
FROM actor
where last_name like '%LI%'
order by last_name, first_name;

-- 3a. Add a middle_name column to the table actor. Position it between first_name and last_name. Hint: you will need to specify the data type.
ALTER TABLE actor
ADD COLUMN middle_name VARCHAR(50) AFTER first_name;

-- 3b. You realize that some of these actors have tremendously long last names. Change the data type of the middle_name column to blobs.
ALTER TABLE actor
MODIFY COLUMN middle_name blob AFTER first_name;

-- 4c. Oh, no! The actor HARPO WILLIAMS was accidentally entered in the actor table as GROUCHO WILLIAMS, the name of Harpo's second cousin's husband's yoga teacher. Write a query to fix the record.
update actor 
set first_name = 'Harpo'
where first_name = 'Groucho' and last_name = 'Williams';

-- 4d. Perhaps we were too hasty in changing GROUCHO to HARPO. It turns out that GROUCHO was the correct name after all! In a single query, if the first name of the actor is currently HARPO, change it to GROUCHO. Otherwise, change the first name to MUCHO GROUCHO, as that is exactly what the actor will be with the grievous error. BE CAREFUL NOT TO CHANGE THE FIRST NAME OF EVERY ACTOR TO MUCHO GROUCHO, HOWEVER! (Hint: update the record using a unique identifier.)
UPDATE actor 
   SET first_name = CASE WHEN first_name = 'Groucho' THEN 'Mucho Groucho' ELSE first_name END,
